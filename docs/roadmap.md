# Roadmap

## WebKit Inspector: Physical iOS Device Support

Currently WebKit Inspector enrichment (visible text, checked state) only works on iOS Simulator. The simulator exposes a Unix domain socket at `/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.*/com.apple.webinspectord_sim.socket` which golem connects to directly.

Physical devices require a different transport path:

- **USB multiplexing** via `usbmuxd` — the system daemon that tunnels TCP over USB to iOS devices
- **Lockdown TLS handshake** — physical devices require a TLS connection using pairing certificates stored in `~/Library/Lockdown/`
- **Device discovery** — enumerate connected devices via usbmuxd, match to the target device

The `golem-driver/src/webkit.rs` transport layer is already designed around a `SimulatorTransport` trait, intended for a future `UsbTransport` implementation that handles the usbmuxd + TLS path.

Without this, physical device test runs still work but WebView elements lack enriched text — falling back to accessibility labels only.

Requires access to a physical iOS device for development and testing.

## `create_if_missing` Honours Slot Constraints

`find_available_device` falls back to `auto_create_device(platform, DeviceType::Phone, …)` when no compatible device exists and `create_if_missing = true` is set in flow options. The hardcoded `Phone` default ignores the slot's `device_type` + `os_version`, so a flow needing an iPad or a specific iOS major will get a phone on latest.

**Fix:** pass `slot.device_type` and `slot.os_version` into the create path. Small, isolated.

**Files:** `golem-cli/src/suite.rs` (auto-create call site), possibly `golem-devices/src/lifecycle.rs` if the helper signature needs widening.

## True Parallel Flow × Device Concurrency

Running `golem run a.toml b.toml` on ios+android = 4 device-runs available but only 2 execute in parallel (one per booted device per platform). Other 2 wait for devices to free. Machines with spare RAM could run all 4 at once.

**Desired:** Boot additional simulators/emulators on demand when:
- `total_device_runs > currently_booted_matching_devices` AND
- Free RAM above threshold (per-device ~2-4GB)

**Limits:** `--max-concurrency <N>` always caps — if N is lower than the heuristic allows, N wins. Default stays 4.

**Cleanup:** Track which sims/emulators golem booted (vs user's) so they can be shut down afterwards. Respects `--keep-devices`.

**Note:** Works with the existing install script support — fresh sims booted on-demand will have their install_script invoked automatically via the existing pipeline.

**Files:** `golem-devices/src/resource_manager.rs` (boot-on-demand logic), `golem-devices/src/concurrency.rs` (headroom checks), `golem-devices/src/{ios,android}.rs` (boot helpers + tracking).

## Coverage Strategy: Residual Polish

The tick-box model is live end-to-end: `CoverageStrategy { One, Min, Smart, Full }` with `Smart` default, `DeviceSlot` with `Option<Platform>` + `booted` axis, greedy set-cover in `golem-orchestrator::coverage`, partial-axis expansion with dedup + underspec errors, and execute-time adaptive JIT for `Smart` + `One` via `CoverageGroup` + shared progress tracker in the scheduler. `FlowReport.covered_axes` is populated from the chosen device and renders in human output.

**What's left:**

### Retire the `slot_platform_or_ios` stopgap

`golem-cli/src/suite.rs` panics when a `None`-platform slot reaches the scheduler. Today's plan generator always pins a platform via `union_requirements`, so the panic arm is unreachable, but the helper still couples the scheduler to a single-platform-at-a-time model. Genuine cross-platform picking (a free iPad covers a platform-None `{tablet}` box just as well as a free Pixel tab) would let the scheduler wait for *any* free matching device instead of guessing a platform upfront.

**Files:** `golem-cli/src/suite.rs` (scheduler device picker accepts `Option<Platform>`), `discover_all_devices` → merge across platforms.

### Auto-create on platform-None slots

A platform-None box that needs auto-creation should error with "cannot auto-create platform-agnostic slot — specify `os = ...`" (subsumes the remaining platform-axis portion of the [`create_if_missing` Honours Slot Constraints](#create_if_missing-honours-slot-constraints) entry). Depends on the cross-platform scheduler above.

### Responsive-design / cross-platform axis sharing

Already works via array syntax on a single `[[flow.apps.devices]]` block: `os = ["ios:latest", "android:latest"]` + `type = ["phone", "tablet"]` emits 4 partial boxes that 2 devices (one per platform, different types) cover end-to-end. Documented in README flow-options.

### Reference: strategy semantics

| Strategy | Box generation | Resolution timing | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `full` | Cartesian — each box fully pinned | plan-time | 1 FlowRun per box |
| `min` | Partial-axis — each axis-value = one box | plan-time: greedy set-cover | Fewest devices; waits on contested |
| `smart` | Partial-axis | execute-time adaptive (CoverageGroup) | **Default.** Stops once every pool box is ticked |
| `one` | Partial-axis | execute-time adaptive (CoverageGroup, `max_runs=1`) | Single successful run; local smoke / dev |

## Partial Suite on Install Failure

If pre-install fails for app `X` on device `D`, today's per-flow install check marks `FailedScript` in the cache and any flow referencing `X` on `D` is skipped. But UX could be sharper:

- Dedicated `FlowSkipped` event with explicit cause (`InstallFailed(X, D)` vs other skip reasons)
- Aggregated suite summary line distinguishing "install-dep-skip" from genuine flow failures
- Flows that don't reference `X` proceed normally (already the case)

**Foundation:** `InstallCache` already keyed on `(udid, bundle)`; per-flow skip logic already exists. This is polish.

**Files:** `golem-events/src/lib.rs` (enrich `FlowSkipped` variant), `golem-report/src/stream.rs` + `accumulator.rs` (render distinct skip reasons).

## `--rebuild` Flag for Forced Install-Script Reruns

With the per-orchestrator `InstallCache`, successive submits transparently reuse prior installs on the same device. When a submit needs to ignore cache hits (e.g. the user changed the build output and wants a fresh install), there's no way to force it today.

**Fix:** add a `--rebuild` CLI flag that clears the relevant cache entries (or short-circuits the lookup) for the submit's apps before preinstall.

**Files:** `golem-cli/src/cli.rs` (flag), `golem-cli/src/suite.rs` (consult flag during preinstall).

## Migrate SuiteRunner + IPC into `golem-orchestrator`

`SuiteRunner` lives in `golem-cli/src/suite.rs` and IPC logic in `golem-cli/src/orchestrator.rs`. Both belong in the orchestrator crate — cleanly separates glue (CLI arg parsing, output rendering) from core (suite execution, multi-process coordination).

**Files:** move `golem-cli/src/suite.rs` → `golem-orchestrator/src/suite.rs`; move `golem-cli/src/orchestrator.rs` → `golem-orchestrator/src/ipc.rs`.

## Force Separate Device per App (`share_device = false`)

By default, `[[flow.apps]]` entries whose device constraints are jointly satisfiable pack into the same physical device to save host resources. For some flows this default is wrong — for example a deep-link test where two apps must be on different devices to exercise cross-device IPC, or an isolation test where sharing a device would contaminate state.

**Proposed TOML:**
```toml
[[flow.apps]]
name = "a"
share_device = false     # opt out of packing — a gets its own device
```

**Implementation:** add `share_device: Option<bool>` (default = true) to `AppConfig` in golem-parser. The `golem-orchestrator` Plan generator honours it when building slot groupings — an app with `share_device = false` always gets its own `DeviceSlot`.

**Where it lands:** the Plan generator already groups `[[flow.apps]]` into `DeviceSlot`s; `share_device = false` becomes an input to that grouping pass.

## Multi-Device Flow Coordination (Chat Tests)

Some flows use two apps on two different devices that must run together (chat client + chat server). Today's suite model spawns a separate flow task per platform; two devices never coordinate inside one flow execution. The new `FlowRun { slots: Vec<DeviceSlot> }` structure supports 2+ slots, but the initial Plan implementation only emits single-slot FlowRuns.

**Implementation:**
- Plan generator detects apps with incompatible `[[flow.apps.devices]]` constraints (e.g. different platforms) and emits one `FlowRun` with a `DeviceSlot` per incompatible group.
- Execute phase acquires ALL slots' devices before starting the flow; runs the flow with multi-device context (flow steps can `{ action = "launch", app = "b" }` to switch focus between devices).
- Device release happens after the whole FlowRun completes, not per-slot.

**Depends on:** clarification of flow-step semantics across devices — which device is "current" at each step, how `{ action = "launch", app = "b" }` switches focus, how assertions scope. The slot infrastructure already exists; the missing piece is step-level semantics.

## Reconcile `[[flow.apps]]` Implementation with Original Spec

Per design notes, some original-spec behaviour around `[[flow.apps]]` and step-level app targeting was not carried through during initial implementation. Examples:
- Default expectation that blocks/steps target the single app when only one is declared.
- `{ action = "launch", app = "app-b" }` switching apps on the same device.
- Device-sharing defaults for multi-app flows.

**Action:** produce a reconciliation doc mapping current implementation against original spec, flag gaps, and either (a) fix the implementation, or (b) update the spec to match current behaviour with a rationale. Low priority but important for long-term clarity.

**Files:** `docs/reconciliation-flow-apps.md` (new), followed by targeted fixes in `golem-parser/src/lib.rs` or `golem-runner/src/executor.rs` depending on findings.

## CLI Flags: Not Yet Functional

Several CLI flags are defined but not yet wired through to execution.

### `--no-teardown` — Skip teardown blocks

Teardown blocks are parsed but never executed. The executor ignores the `teardown` field — no teardown logic runs after flows. The `no_teardown` config field is stored but there is nothing to skip.

### `--no-clean` — Skip app data clear

No app data cleaning logic exists in the execution path. The flag is accepted but there is nothing to skip.

### `--record` — Auto screen recording

Flag is accepted but never triggers recording. Recording only works via explicit `start_recording`/`stop_recording` steps in flows.

### `--max-concurrency <N>` — Parallel device limit

Flag is defined but never read. `ResourceManager` uses default concurrency config regardless of this value.

## Flow Options: Not Yet Wired

These `[flow.options]` fields are parsed into `FlowOptions` but never read during execution.

### `record` / `recording_dir` — Auto recording

Both parsed but ignored. `CaptureConfig` hardcodes `record: false` and `recording_dir: .golem/recordings`. Recording only works via explicit `start_recording`/`stop_recording` steps.

`screenshot_dir` and `recording_dir` are superseded by the unified output directory design (see below).

## Ethereal Email Integration

`golem-email` crate has a working `EtherealClient` that creates temporary inboxes via the Nodemailer API (`https://api.nodemailer.com/user`), and an `ImapPoller` that polls IMAP for matching emails. Both are tested but not wired into the runner or generator system.

Intended usage: a `fake:email(ethereal=true)` parameter or a dedicated `fake:ethereal_email` generator that creates a real temporary inbox and exposes IMAP credentials as structured fields (`imap_host`, `imap_port`, `user`, `pass`). This would feed directly into `await_email`'s `inbox` parameter for end-to-end email verification flows.

This needs design work before implementation. The full email verification flow spans multiple concerns: creating the inbox, sending the email (via the app under test), polling for arrival, extracting content (verification URLs, OTP codes), and feeding extracted values back into the flow as variables. The `await_email` action already has `extract` (regex patterns) and `save_to`, but the end-to-end ergonomics — how a test author wires up `fake:email` → app signup → `await_email` → `open_link` — need to be planned as a cohesive feature.

Files: `golem-email/src/ethereal.rs`, `golem-email/src/imap_poller.rs`.

## TOON Timestamp Representation

Human, JSON, and JUnit outputs already emit wall-clock timestamps (local `HH:MM:SS.mmm` prefix for human; ISO-8601 UTC on every report level for JSON/JUnit). TOON is intentionally left out — its compactness-first design would bloat meaningfully with full ISO-8601 strings (16+ chars) per entry.

**Open proposal:** emit a single suite-level `start` unix-epoch timestamp once, then per-event `delta_ms` relative to suite start. A 30-minute suite = 7-digit delta; easy to reconstruct absolute time from `start + delta_ms`.

Needs a concrete schema decision before implementing. Today TOON emits `duration_ms` only.

**Files:** `golem-report/src/toon.rs` once schema is agreed.

## Skipped Step Reasons Across All Outputs

Skipped steps carry no reason today: a ` -tap:Cancel` line in TOON (or `<skipped/>` in JUnit, `"outcome": "skipped"` in JSON) tells the reader *that* a step was skipped, not *why*.

**Fix:** add `skip_reason: Option<String>` to `StepReport`. Populate from flow execution when a step is conditionally skipped (e.g. `if:` predicate false, barrier-aborted, start-block cursor past this step). Surface per renderer:

- Human stream: `─ tap:Cancel (skipped: barrier aborted)`
- JSON: `"skip_reason": "barrier aborted"`
- JUnit: `<skipped message="barrier aborted"/>`
- TOON: ` -tap:Cancel :barrier_aborted` (short reason token; long reasons truncated)

Also roadmap-adjacent: consider whether `golem_events::StepOutcome::Skipped` should become `Skipped(String)` symmetrically with `Warning(String)` / `Failed(String)`, or keep `Skipped` as-is and pass the reason via a sibling event/field. Second option keeps the common case small.

**Files:** `golem-events/src/lib.rs` (StepOutcome shape), `golem-runner/src/executor.rs` (populate reasons at skip decision), `golem-report/src/{accumulator,human,json,junit,toon}.rs` (surface).

## iOS WebView: Slow Element Resolution Between Consecutive Actions

Consecutive `type` actions on iOS WebView elements are slow — resolving the second input field after typing in the first takes >10s. The DOM tree changes after each keystroke (WebKit enrichment re-fetches), and finding the next element requires waiting for the tree to settle.

Example: `e2e/cross/webview.test.toml` step 7 (`type on_text="Search"`) times out at 10s even though the previous `type` (step 5) completes in ~3.6s. The bottleneck is element resolution, not keystroke delivery.

Possible approaches:
- Smarter settle detection that recognizes when WebView content is still updating
- Cache element positions across consecutive steps when the viewport hasn't changed
- Longer default multiplier for WebView-context actions (requires detecting WebView context)

## e2e Flakiness: Tap "Submit" not found on cold-boot iOS

`e2e/cross/tap.test.toml` under `coverage = "one"` on a freshly auto-booted iOS 26 simulator: the first `tap on_text="Submit"` times out after 30s. The sim boots, install succeeds, companion starts, but the app either never renders the Submit button or its identifier differs by version. Reproduces reliably on iOS 26 auto-boot; passes on Android and on already-booted iOS simulators.

Possible causes: launch race between companion readiness and app first-frame; Submit accessibility label differs by iOS major; cold-boot keyboard/WebView priming issue.

**Files:** investigation first — add post-launch screenshot + tree dump to `e2e/cross/tap.test.toml` to capture what's actually on screen when the timeout fires.

## e2e Flakiness: Tap roundtrip iOS increment tap timeout

`e2e/perf/tap_roundtrip.test.toml` under `ios:latest:2` (iOS 18 + 26) sees the first `tap on_text="+"` time out after 5s on both versions. The app launches, counter is visible at "0", then the tap step hangs. Pre-existing before the `:latest:2` change — smart fan-out just makes it repro on two iOS versions instead of one.

Likely related to perf-test-specific companion/driver race or accessibility label drift on the `+` button. Android passes cleanly.

**Files:** `e2e/perf/tap_roundtrip.test.toml`, possibly `golem-driver/src/ios.rs` tap path.
