### Pinning a Specific Device by Name

```toml
[[flow.apps.devices]]
name = "iPhone 15"
```

`name` pins an exact device display name (as shown by `golem devices` / `xcrun simctl list` / `adb devices -l`). Use this when you have a customised simulator or a specific physical device the flow must target.

With `create_if_missing`, an unknown name errors instead of creating a simulator.
