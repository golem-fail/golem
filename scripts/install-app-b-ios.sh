#!/usr/bin/env bash
# golem install script — native iOS (simulator + physical)
#
# Invoked by golem before each flow to build and install the app onto a
# target device. Runs from the project root.
#
# Args:
#   $1 = platform (always "ios" for this template)
#   $2 = device UDID
#   $3 = bundle id (from [[flow.apps]] bundle)
#   $4 = "install-only" to skip the build and reuse the previous artifact,
#        or empty for full build+install (default).
#        Golem currently always passes empty; the flag is supported for manual
#        dev-iteration and for a future golem-side build-once optimisation
#        (see roadmap: "Install Cache: Build-Once, Install-to-Many").
#
# Environment (template config — set via [[apps]] install_env or the shell):
#   CONFIGURATION    = overrides the build configuration below (Debug, Release)
#   XCODE_SCHEME     = overrides the scheme below
#   XCCONFIG         = path to an .xcconfig, passed as `xcodebuild -xcconfig`
#   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = Apple team ID for a physical device. Passed as the
#                      DEVELOPMENT_TEAM build setting, with
#                      -allowProvisioningUpdates. Unset: the project's own
#                      signing settings apply.
#   DERIVED_DATA     = xcodebuild derived-data dir (default ./build/DerivedData)
#
# Detects simulator vs physical device by checking simctl. Physical device
# install requires Xcode 15+ (`xcrun devicectl`).
#
# Exit 0 on success; nonzero on failure (stderr surfaces to golem).
